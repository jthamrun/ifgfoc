# ifgfoc
This is the source code that was written for IFGF OC's church website.

For this website, my partner and I used HTML, CSS and Javscript to design its
FrontEnd. We used Python and Django to build the BackEnd of the website. 
Additionally, we used SQL to handle the many connect cards, prayer cards that
church members will be submitting.
